# Unit 2 - Introduction to Linux 
A collection of my notes. 

A open source, unix like operating system kernel. 

Stucture of linux - Divided into 5 main layers

1. User

2. system libraries

3. shell

4. kernel

5. hardware 

**Hardware**

* A physical parts of computer,includeing CPU which executes instruction.
* Memory - RAM, ROM - which stores data
* Computer devices like keybord, mouse, disk etc - which helps for interaction within the system. 

**Kernel**

* Also called as heart of linux
* It manages hardware and system resources. 
* Handles the execution of programs
* Manages and allocates the memory
* Communicates with hardware
* Provide access to files and organizes files.

**Shell**

* It acts like a bridge between the kernel and the user.
* It takes command from users and convert it to comuter language and tranfer it to kernel, because kernel can only understand computer language
   

**System librabries**

* These provide functions which helps applications to interact with the kernel directly without accessing it. 



**Linux distributions**
There are multiple linux distributions, currently we are using Ubuntu, which is user friendly, great for beginners.

**Features of linux**

* Known for its multi tasking ability
* It supports multiple users work simultaneously
* Since its a open source anyone can alter or modify it and districute.
* It runs in a wide range.
